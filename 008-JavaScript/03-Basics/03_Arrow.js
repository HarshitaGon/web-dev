/*
    Explanation:

    * function chai() is a regular function.
    * In a regular function, this refers to the calling object.
    * But since chai() is called in the global scope (not as an object method), this refers to:
        In Browser: The window object
        In Node.js: The global object
    * Since username is defined inside the function and not attached to this, console.log(this.username); returns undefined.

// Arrow Functions :---------------------------------------

/*
    Explanation:

    * chaii() is an arrow function.
    * Arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they inherit this from their lexical (surrounding) scope.
    * In this case, chaii() is defined in the global scope, so this still refers to the global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js).
    * Since username is a local variable inside the function and not attached to this, output remains undefined.

/*
    Explanation of above line of code :

    When returning an object, you must wrap it in parentheses () to prevent JavaScript from treating {} as a function body.
    Without parentheses, {} is considered the function block, and it wonâ€™t return anything.

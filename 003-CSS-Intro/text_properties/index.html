    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They
        belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses,
        and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone,
         which is used for control of buoyancy.

    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and
        other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks),
        seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
        cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish
        to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have
        one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.

    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
        temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
        they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have
        an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East
        and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts
        of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the
        time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic
        possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to cross.

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure
        called the cuttlebone, a highly modified internal shell, which is porous and
        is made of aragonite. Except for spirula, they are the only coleoid cephalopods
        with a shell with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.
